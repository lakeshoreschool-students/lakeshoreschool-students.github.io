    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Fear of not knowing people and difficulty making friends</h2>
    <p>
    One of the first things that you might me worried when joining a new school is about not knowing people and being scared to talk to people and 
    becoming friends with them. This is very common as you are introduced to types of people that you know nothing about, especially in an unfamiliar area.
    <br><br>

    But don't worry! None of the students know anything about you either and there might be some new people aswell, so don't be afraid to talk to them. Try 
    asking them about their hobbies, interests and other things which could help make you friends. But remember to be nice and tolerant towards others, as their norms
    can be different to yours. Also, it could take a few days to find someone who would want to be a friend, so don't worry about making a bad impression. And remember, you will always fit in.

        One of the other things that students are worried about when joining a new school is the teachers and the school staff. You might feel 
        nervous and anxious when talking to them because you haven't met them before and you could feel like you're bothering them. But don't worry! 
        They are happy to help you with anything and they will try their best to help, so don't hesitate or be nervous around them.
