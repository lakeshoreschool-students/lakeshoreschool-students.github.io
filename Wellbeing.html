    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Fear of not knowing people and difficulty making friends</h2>
    <p>
    One of the first things that you might me worried when joining a new school is about not knowing people and being scared to talk to people and 
    becoming friends with them. This is very common as you are introduced to types of people that you know nothing about, especially in an unfamiliar area.
    <br><br>
    <img style="width: 40%; word-wrap: normal; float: right; position: sticky; margin-right: 3px;" src="Images/friend.jpg">
    But don't worry! None of the students know anything about you either and there might be some new people aswell, so don't be afraid to talk to them. Try 
    asking them about their hobbies, interests and other things which could help make you friends. But remember to be nice and tolerant towards others, as their norms
    can be different to yours. Also, it could take a few days to find someone who would want to be a friend, so don't worry about making a bad impression. And remember, you will always fit in.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Fear of not knowing teachers and school staff</h2>
    <p>
        <img style="width: 40%; word-wrap: normal; float: right; position: sticky; margin-right: 3px;" src="Images/teacher.jpg">
        One of the other things that students are worried about when joining a new school is the teachers and the school staff. You might feel 
        nervous and anxious when talking to them because you haven't met them before and you could feel like you're bothering them. But don't worry! 
        They are happy to help you with anything and they will try their best to help, so don't hesitate or be nervous around them.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Fear of not being able to keep up with work</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/student-writing.webp" style="width: 40%; word-wrap: normal; float: right; position: sticky; margin-right: 3px;" >
        Another thing that students are worried about when joining a new school is school work. You could feel nervous about the workloads, subjects and 
        the difficulty of them, especially when your new school has a different curriculum compared to your old one. But don't worry! You will be explained about 
        everything by our professional teachers and you are free to ask for help with any work you might have. Also, you would get used to the work overtime and it would 
        feel normal to you after about a week, so don't stress over this.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Fear of not being able to navigate around the school</h2>
    <p>
        <img style="width: 40%; word-wrap: normal; float: right; position: sticky; margin-right: 3px;" src="Images/walking-guy.webp">
        Another thing that students are worried about when joining a new school is finding your way around school. This could be because you never have been to this school and 
        you could feel scared about coming late to class because you were lost and make a bad first impression to the teacher. Fortunately, you can find information about the layout 
        of the school in one of our webpages! Click on the "Information about your school" button and use the table to find your grade and information specific to it. This would help you 
        know the general layout of the school and make navigating the school nuch easier.

    <p>

        In conclusion, remember that feeling this is completely normal and that it happens to everyone once in a while, as you're being put in a 
        new place with new people. To have a peaceful mind, just remember your first days at your other schools and how it turned out in the end. 
        Try to remember your friends and teachers. This will assure you that it will turn out good in the end, just like it always did.
